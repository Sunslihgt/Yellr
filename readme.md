# 🚨 YELLR  
**_Where Everyone’s Loud_**  
*...and nobody listens.*

**YELLR** is the world's most _unapologetically chaotic_ microblogging platform. 🦅 We believe in **free** speech , especially the kind that involves shouting into the void while everyone else is doing the same. 🗣️ Built for those who want to be heard 💪 - but never want to listen .

## 👷‍♂️ Development

Yellr is a _**Twitter/X clone**_ made by 3 students at CESI Graduate School of Engineering at Saint-Nazaire (_A3 INFO FISA 2024-2027_).<br>
The project uses the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) with Typescript and Tailwind.

## ▶️ Running the Project

To start the project using Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start all necessary services. The optional flag `--build` will also build the project to be deployable.<br>
_If you need to customize environment variables, edit the `.env` file before running._

## 🆗 Linting

To check code style and run linters, use the provided script:

```sh
./lint.sh
```

This script will run the configured linters and report any issues.
